Give it a good shake you really want to make sure you shake this well before adding it back to the meat mixture now stir this mixture until well combined. Now it's time to assemble our lasagna we'll start by adding 1 cup of our meat sauce to the bottom of 13 x nine baking dish let's add three of our uncooked lasagna noodles. We'll talk this with a third of the ricota  chesse filling and let's spread this around now your going to repeat this step until your last layer you add the last three lasagna noodles and we'll top it with the remainder of the meat sauce. After, we'll top the lasagna with our cheese I have one and quarter cups of shredded Mozzarella Cheese and one quarter cup of grated parmesan cheese and now we can can cover the lasgagna with foil that's been sprayed with cooking spray and this is going to prevent the cheese from sticking to the aluminum foil bake the lasagna for 1 hour or heated though at 350 degrees removing the foil after 45 mintues once cooked alllow the lasagna to stand for 15 mintues before cuttting to serve 12. </h3>
