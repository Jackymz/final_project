    <h2>Ingredient For Lasagna</h2>
  <li>One pound of ground beef</li>
  <li>One contianer (15 oz.) Ricotta cheese</li>
  <li>1-1/4 of shredded Mozzarella</li>
    <li>1/4 grated parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>1/4 cup copped fresh parsely</li>
    <li>1 beaten egg</li>
    <li>1 jar (24oz.) spaghetti sauce</li>
    <li>1 cup of water</li>
    <li>12 lasagna noddles, uncooked</li>
    <li>foil</li>
    <li>glass pan</li>
</ul>

<h3>First we will are going to brown one pound of grouund beef in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Then we will make the filling for the lasagna in a bowl we have a 15 oz. container of Ricotta Chesse and to that we will add one and a quarter cups  of shredded Mozzarella Chesse. Next a quarter cup of grated Parmesan chesse, 1/4 cup of chopped fresshh parsley, one egg and let's mix this up until it's combined well. Now that the meat is cooked through we're going to drain it and then return it to the skillet add 1 24oz. of spaghetti sauce to the meat and now we're going to add 1 cup of water to the spaghetti sauce jar put the lid back on close it tight. Give it a good shake you really want to make sure you shake this well before adding it back to the meat mixture now stir this mixture until well combined. Now it's time to assemble our lasagna we'll start by adding 1 cup of our meat sauce to the bottom of 13 x nine baking dish let's add three of our uncooked lasagna noodles. We'll talk this with a third of the ricota  chesse filling and let's spread this around now your going to repeat this step until your last layer you add the last three lasagna noodles and we'll top it with the remainder of the meat sauce. After, we'll top the lasagna with our cheese I have one and quarter cups of shredded Mozzarella Cheese and one quarter cup of grated parmesan cheese and now we can can cover the lasgagna with foil that's been sprayed with cooking spray and this is going to prevent the cheese from sticking to the aluminum foil bake the lasagna for 1 hour or heated though at 350 degrees removing the foil after 45 mintues once cooked alllow the lasagna to stand for 15 mintues before cuttting to serve 12. </h3>

    <h2>Ingredient For French Macrons and Cream Cheese</h2>
    <li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>
    <li>3/4 cup almond flour</li>
    <li>1 Tbsp. unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
    <li>2 egg whites (room temperature)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    <li>red food coloring</li>
    <li>4 oz softened cream cheese</li>
    <li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>
    <li>3/4 cup of heavy cream</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
<h3>First you going to have to separate two egg whites and let the egg whites just fall into large bowl. Then, seprate large bowl you want to sift the dry ingredients to start with 1 cup of powdered suagar and just sip that through once that is done we can now sit three quarter of a cup of almond flour. Next, we can sift the one tablespoon of unsweetened coca powder one this is done use a whisk to combine all dry ingredients together and just set this bowl aside now we're going to start with our meringue you want to start whipping the egg whites that we separated eariler and once it becomes thicker and foamy. Add a quarter cup of granulated sugar you want to add the  sugar gradually about 1 tablespoon at a time so after another two minutes of whipping here I added a little bit more of the sugar and then atfer would being for about another one or two minutes i just added the rest of the sugar your want to beat this until it forms soft peaks once it does you can add the red food coloring along with a half teaspoon of vanilla extract and remember that the  macaroons bake much lighter in colorof the batter so just whip this until it forms the semi stiff peaks don't overbeat it or the texture of your macaron batter will be ruined so now we can start folding in the dry ingredients I like to add mine about hlaf at a time to fold all you do is just scoop underneath the bowl and then just fold it over you want to do this gently so that all the air is not taken out of the meringue now you can add rest of the dry ingredients and contiune folding. Now you want to achieve the perfect consistency when making this batter so even when it's fully combined like this it might not be the correct consistency you know it's ready when you can kind of lift it up with your spatula and it kind of drip down so I transferred my batter to a pastry bag with a round tip and I'm piping my macarons onto a parchment paper as well I'm using paper templates I printed out  from online to help me make them the perfect size. Bang the ray on the countertop so that the extra bubble can pop and they could kind of flatten out and get their shape now you want to let these set for about 30  minutes to an hour once thay are matt and form a thin film and you can touch them with your finger and no wet batter goes on to your finger you know they're ready so baked about 300F or 150 Celsius for 16 to 18 mintues in the meantime I made this cream cheese whipped frosting so now we are going to beat the cream cheese make sure this is softened at room temperature before you do this you just wanted to become very light and airy and then you're going to be adding the powdered sugar and here I'm adding about half a teaspoon of vanilla extract and just contiune beating the mixture here I added the rest of the powdered sugar and some heavy cream in this recipe  I use a lot of heavy cream because as I said before it's kind of like whipped cream and cream cheese frosting together the whipped cream really adds a lightness to this frosting it will become liquidy once you add it but when you keep on reading it will become more stiff and creamy so here I'm adding the restt of the heavy whipping cream after about two minutes it should turn out to be something like semi stiff preaks now I'm transferring the frosting into a pastry bag so now you can put the frosting onto the macrons.</h3>
